    "Initially, to aproach a problem a Data Scientist would carefully formulate the question that they are looking to answer. A clear and well formulated question will determine the research and will also affect the kind of data to gather. After answering that, we need to gather the data  and clean it, lookout for errors, lookout for missing data or incomplete data, in fact, we have to explore the data that we've gathered, and often this means visualising the data so we can better understand on what it is that we are working with. A graph or a chart is much more helpfull than a table of numbers.\n",
